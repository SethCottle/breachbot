##### PURPOSE

I'm open sourcing all of the intent for BreachBot. Intent is a representation of the mapping between what a user says and what action BreachBot takes.

Intent interfaces have the following sections:
* User says
* Action
* Response
* Contexts

##### WHY?

By making the intent for BreachBot open source, it will allow the community to fact check the information BreachBot is providing, this also gives users an easy way to submit errors as well as submit corrections.
